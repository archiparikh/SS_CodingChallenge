Encryption/Decryption Commands:

To encrypt a text file, run the following command on the command line (replacing /path-to-file/filename.txt with the actual file path):

php bin/console app:cipher /path-to-file/filename.txt Encryption -c Simple

For example: php bin/console app:cipher /sample-data/cipher/plain.txt Encryption -c Simple


To decrypt an encrypted text file, run the following command on the command line (replacing /path-to-file/filename.txt with the actual file path):

php bin/console app:cipher /path-to-file/filename.txt Decryption -c Simple

For example: php bin/console app:cipher /sample-data/cipher/decrypted.txt Decryption -c Simple


The resulting encrytpted file will be placed at sample-data/cipher/encrypted_simple.txt
The resulting decrytpted file will be placed at sample-data/cipher/decrypted_simple.txt

Cipher Key:

The cipher key was determined (by examining a known plain text file) to be as follows:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz => zhimneyxwvutsrqpolkjgfdcba

Cipher Key Solution:

The Cipher key was solved via the following process.
1) The word 'JXN' in the encrypted file was repeated the most times and so was mapped to the word 'The' (most common word in plain text file).
2) The phrase 'hb Dwttwzs Kxzunkpnzln' was at the beginning of the encrypted file and was hypothesized to be the words 'by William Shakespeare'.

And using the similar process the rest of the alphabets were mapped correctly. 
However, I could not determine any particular pattern or mathematicl equation used for this cipher.
